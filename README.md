## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript


### What I learned

This was my first project with React and TypeScript so I learnt a lot about the process, how to build the project, lots about React, and how to deploy to Github pages. It wasn't as intuative as I thought it might be. 

I enjoyed the process and the styling was fun! The toggle switch between themes is very satisfying.
